- [ ] Signed the appropriate NDAs and employment agreements
- [ ] Completed security training and clearance
- [ ] Access to internal development resources
- [ ] Development environment properly configured

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository (internal access required)
git clone https://github.com/scorpius/enterprise-platform.git
cd enterprise-platform

# Install dependencies
make install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Configure your environment variables
```

### 2. Development Tools

Required tools:
- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Rust (for core components)
- kubectl (for Kubernetes deployment)

### 3. IDE Configuration

Recommended: VS Code with extensions:
- Python
- TypeScript
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- GitLens

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

```
main            # Production-ready code
├── develop     # Integration branch
├── feature/*   # Feature branches
├── hotfix/*    # Critical fixes
└── release/*   # Release preparation
```

### Commit Standards

Follow conventional commits:

```
type(scope): description

Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
Scopes: core, frontend, backend, security, deploy, docs
```

Examples:
```bash
feat(security): add quantum encryption module
fix(core): resolve MEV detection false positives
docs(api): update authentication endpoints
```
