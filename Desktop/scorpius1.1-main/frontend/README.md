Frontend application and assets

## Installation

The frontend works across macOS, Linux, and Windows environments. Ensure Node.js 20 or later is installed on your system.

### macOS & Linux

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Windows

Use **WSL** or a shell such as Git Bash for the best compatibility with the project scripts.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
