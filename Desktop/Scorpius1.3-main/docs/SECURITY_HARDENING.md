# Scorpius Enterprise Security Hardening

## Supply Chain Security

### 1. Digest-Pinned Base Images
All Docker images use digest-pinned base images to ensure reproducibility and security:
- `python:3.11-alpine@sha256:7e61c0ad2f7ba28cd4b78df90f9e6ec83b3fa5ad5265b0e7b5a8e5e6e6c9b3e2`

### 2. CI Security Checks
The CI pipeline includes comprehensive security checks:
- Trivy scanning for HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities
- SBOM generation with Syft
- Image signing with Cosign
- Dependency security checks with Safety

## Secrets Management

### AWS Secrets Manager Integration
All sensitive configuration is managed through AWS Secrets Manager:
- Secrets are loaded at runtime
- Automatic 90-day rotation
- IAM least-privilege access

## Network Security

### Kubernetes Network Policies
Strict network isolation policies:
- API Gateway → Backend services (80/443)
- Backend services → RDS (5432)
- Backend services → Redis (6379)
- No direct egress allowed

### Kyverno Policies
Runtime security enforcement:
- Root user execution prohibited
- Pod security context enforced
- Container security policies enforced

## Testing & Quality

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: ≥80% coverage
- Mutation testing: ≥60% mutants killed
- Integration tests: Mainnet fork testing

### Chaos Engineering
- Regular chaos testing with Litmus
- Automated disaster recovery drills
- DNS failover testing

## Monitoring & Observability

### OpenTelemetry Integration
- Distributed tracing with Grafana Tempo
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Alerting integration with Grafana On-Call

### Cost Optimization
- OpenCost integration for cost monitoring
- Daily spend alerts
- Resource optimization recommendations

## Developer Experience
