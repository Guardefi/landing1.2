# Contract Sandboxing and Exploit Testing Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive contract sandboxing system using Foundry/Anvil to run exploit simulations in isolated environments for vulnerability testing.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. ContractSandbox Class (`contract_sandbox.py`)

- **Isolated Testing Environments**: Creates sandboxed environments using Anvil forks
- **Exploit Template Library**: Pre-built Solidity exploit contracts for common vulnerability types
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Supports reentrancy, flash loan, governance, and oracle manipulation attacks
- **Real Contract Deployment**: Deploy target contracts for testing in sandbox environments
- **Professional Audit Reports**: Generate comprehensive security audit reports with risk scoring

### 2. Exploit Templates Implemented

```solidity
// Reentrancy Exploit Template
contract ReentrancyExploit is Test {
    // Tests for recursive call vulnerabilities
    // Measures value extracted and gas usage
}

// Flash Loan Exploit Template
contract FlashLoanExploit is Test {
    // Tests for flash loan attack vectors
    // Simulates price manipulation scenarios
}

// Governance Attack Template
contract GovernanceExploit is Test {
    // Tests for governance manipulation
    // Simulates malicious proposal execution
}

// Oracle Manipulation Template
contract OracleManipulationExploit is Test {
    // Tests for price oracle vulnerabilities
    // Simulates price manipulation attacks
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Simulation API Endpoints

- **POST /api/simulation/sandbox/create** - Create isolated sandbox environment
- **POST /api/simulation/sandbox/{sandbox_id}/deploy** - Deploy contracts for testing
- **POST /api/simulation/sandbox/{sandbox_id}/exploit-test** - Run specific exploit tests
- **POST /api/simulation/sandbox/{sandbox_id}/security-audit** - Run comprehensive security audit
- **GET /api/simulation/sandbox/{sandbox_id}/test/{test_id}/results** - Get detailed test results
- **DELETE /api/simulation/sandbox/{sandbox_id}** - Clean up sandbox environment

## Sandboxing Capabilities

### Environment Management

- **Anvil Fork Integration**: Uses existing AdvancedSimulationRunner infrastructure
- **Block Number Forking**: Create environments at specific historical blocks
- **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup of sandbox environments
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Run multiple isolated tests simultaneously

### Exploit Testing Features

- **Real Contract Execution**: Deploy and test actual Solidity contracts
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Automated detection of common exploit patterns
- **Gas Analysis**: Detailed gas usage tracking for exploit transactions
- **Value Extraction Measurement**: Calculate profits from successful exploits
- **Execution Tracing**: Complete transaction trace data for analysis

### Security Audit System

```python
# Comprehensive audit results
{
    "audit_id": "uuid",
    "target_contract": "0x...",
    "tests_run": [
        {
            "exploit_type": "reentrancy",
            "success": true,
            "vulnerabilities": ["reentrancy", "state_manipulation"],
            "gas_used": 150000,
            "value_extracted": 1000.0
        }
    ],
    "vulnerabilities_summary": {
        "reentrancy": 1,
        "flash_loan_attack": 0
    },
    "overall_risk_score": 80,
    "recommendations": [
        "Implement checks-effects-interactions pattern",
        "Use OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard"
    ]
}
```

## Exploit Test Results Structure

```python
@dataclass
class ExploitTestResult:
    test_id: str
    contract_address: str
    exploit_type: str
    success: bool
    vulnerabilities_found: List[str]
    gas_used: int
    value_extracted: float
    execution_time: float
    trace_data: Dict[str, Any]
    mitigation_suggestions: List[str]
    poc_code: str  # Complete Proof of Concept code
    timestamp: datetime
```

## Mitigation Strategy Generation
