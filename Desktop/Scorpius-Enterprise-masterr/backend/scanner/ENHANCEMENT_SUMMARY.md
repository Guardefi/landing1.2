from core.models import Target

analyzer = EnhancedVulnerabilityAnalyzer({
    "anthropic_api_key": "your_key_here",
    "enable_simulation": True,
    "parallel_execution": True
})

target = Target(address="0x...", type="contract")
result = await analyzer.analyze_comprehensive(
    target=target,
    source_code=source_code
)

print(f"Found {len(result.vulnerabilities)} vulnerabilities")
print(f"Risk Score: {result.risk_assessment.overall_score}/10")
